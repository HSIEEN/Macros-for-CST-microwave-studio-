# Macros when simulating an antenna in CST Microwave Studio
## Some macros in VBA for CST microwave studio.

Some functions are as follows:

*Estimate average efficiency in a specified band.

*Estimate upper or lower hemisphere efficiency 

*Estimate RHCP and LHCP gain and efficiency and Write them to an xls file

*Automatically simplify model

*Automatically assign materials for solids

*Estimate losses of all materials

*Estimate and plot axial ratio vs frequency at specified angles

*Automatically slice solids with specified steps or angles

*Automatically optimize single parameter for frequency tunning. Binary search methods are applied

*Automatically sweep single parameter for antenna radiation characteristics check and generate logs to record key information

*Auto-format 1D plot: bolden the curve and font for the convenience of screenshot

*Auto-replace solids with a brick or cylinder to simplify the model

*Select two 1D results and do subtraction

*Import and formating test data from GTS test system
